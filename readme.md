## Overview

## Quickstart

Pushing to main triggers a production build with an endpoint at the [cloud run url](https://actions_workflow_url).

This doubles as a target for redocs self documentation, so feel free to reference it at any time. It's live and usually stable

However, if you want to run a local workflow, run

```
docker compose-up
```

This will spin up a container on port 5000 with hot reloading tracking your changes in real time

You can then navigate to [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000/redoc) instead.
